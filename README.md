### Hello, I'm Kleanthis ðŸ‘‹

As an aspiring and diligent postgraduate student, I seek to enter the world of finance as a quantitative analyst. My devotion and determination to achieve my goals and 
my willingness to develop my level of knowledge in finance are key parts of my mentality. As the volume and complexity of financial data are constantly increasing, I try 
to gain computational  and statistical skills, in order to enhance my decision-making and problem-solving abilities. I am currently working on the University of Glasgow 
as a research assistant intern.
